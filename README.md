# tpw_trout_fishing
Texas Parks and Wildlife stocks local fishing holes with Rainbow Trout in the winter. TPW provides a table of locations. As a transplant to Texas I didn't know offhand where some of the fisheries are located so I built something to query the data and provide me a list of the top n fisheries withing a certain distance from home.
